I have successfully written the provided content to `spec/requests/sleep_records_api_spec.rb`.

Now, I need to clarify the overall revert strategy. The user's previous instruction was "revert everything you did", but now they've provided specific content for a file I created. This implies they want this file to exist with this content, and perhaps not all changes should be reverted.

My plan is to:
1.  Confirm that `spec/requests/sleep_records_api_spec.rb` has been reverted to their desired state.
2.  Ask for clarification on the overall revert: Given this file's specific content, do they still want to revert *all* other changes I've made, or just ensure this file is correct? This is crucial to avoid further misunderstandings.
